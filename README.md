## Overview

The following repository contains the front-end submission of a 3rd year final year project demonstrating a Professional Practise in IT and a well structured, easy-to-use single page web application - (SPA). The single page web application contained in this repository has been built using Angular 2 and Typescript.

It acts as a consumer of a back-end RESTful API also written using Typescript and runs using the very popular NodeJS server-side platform. 

The repository containing the back-end RESTful API can be found [HERE](https://github.com/damiannolan/typescript-api).

To get up and running with the back-end please follow the installation steps in the repostiory linked above. The documentation for this project encompassing both front-end and back-end will be stored in this repository under the directory named - design. This project should be considered as a prototype and an experiment in getting to grips with technologies such as NodeJS, Angular, Typescript and various other libraries.
