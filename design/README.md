## Introduction

In the following the project I set out with the mission in my mind of getting a single page web application – (SPA) up and running using Angular 2 and having the entire back-end written in Typescript and running on NodeJS. In the beginning I aspired to have a rich front end with various different features for users to interact with. My idea was to create a platform in which Musicians and like-minded individuals with an interest for music could come together and write article posts about experiences and act as a noticeboard for users to post about buying and selling equipment or musicians seeking like-minded people to collaborate with. However, my focus was driven more towards learning about technologies that I was given little or no exposure to in college in order to apply myself and essentially test my ability of learning about new technologies when being thrown in the deep end. As a result of this and the limitations of time that come along with learning new technologies and balancing other modules, my single page web application became more primitive. However, what I gained in knowledge of building SPA’s, RESTful web services and how to structure and maintain a web based project is where I feel I succeeded.
